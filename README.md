# Bacterial Growth Simulation

This project is a Python simulation of bacterial growth under various environmental and antibiotic conditions. It models the growth of bacterial populations over time, taking into account factors like temperature, pH, nutrient availability, and the impact of antibiotics on resistant and non-resistant populations.

## Features

- Models bacterial population dynamics with antibiotic resistance.
- Includes environmental factors like temperature, pH, oxygen, and moisture levels.
- Simulates the depletion of nutrients and accumulation of waste.
- Provides graphical visualization of:
  - Total, non-resistant, and resistant bacterial populations over time.
  - Antibiotic efficiency decay over time.
  - Environmental conditions (temperature and pH) over time.
  - Waste accumulation and nutrient depletion over time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`
  - `tkinter` (for user inputs, included with Python)

To install the necessary packages, run:
```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy
